# Project History

Sarvadrushti began in early 2024 as a research initiative focused on situational awareness and robust computer vision under adverse environmental conditions.

The work was carried out as part of institutional and incubator-associated research activities and underwent internal evaluations and review cycles. During this period, intermediate code, datasets, and tooling were not publicly released due to confidentiality, review, and compliance requirements.

The repository was created after the conclusion of these evaluations to release non-restricted artifacts derived from the project, including curated dataset indices and supporting utilities. As a result, the public Git history reflects the open-source release timeline rather than the original inception of the research.

Project status: Completed / Archived.
